# PYTHON-ASSIGNMENTS
# PYTHON FUNDAMENTALS
In this set of exercises, you will explore Python fundamentals through various hands-on tasks. You will begin by printing basic information, including your name, student number, and email, both normally and using escape sequences. Then, you will perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using given numbers. You will also practice printing numbers in steps and formatting text with special characters like quotation marks and line breaks.

Next, you will work with different data types by defining variables, checking their types, and performing type conversions. You will calculate the total number of minutes in a year using variables for days, hours, and minutes. Additionally, you will take user input to display a personalized greeting message. Finally, you will create a program named PoundsToDollars.py that takes an amount in pounds (£) as input and converts it into dollars ($). These exercises will help you develop a strong foundation in Python programming by working with printing, escape sequences, arithmetic operations, variables, user input, and type conversions. 
# DATA STRUCTURES
In this exercise, you will explore four fundamental Python data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. You will start by creating a list of random numbers, updating it with new values, and using a loop to print each element. Then, you will work with dictionaries by defining key-value pairs and adding new data dynamically. Moving on to sets, you will perform basic operations such as adding and removing elements. Finally, you will create a tuple, determine its length, and understand its immutable nature. These exercises will enhance your understanding of data storage, retrieval, and manipulation in Python.
# CONDITIONAL AND LOOPING STATEMENTS
In this set of exercises, you will practice essential Python programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, user input handling, and mathematical operations. You will start by creating a program that maps numbers to month names, followed by a ticket pricing system based on age using conditional statements. Then, you will work on calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) and categorizing weight status. You will also implement a program to find the greatest of three numbers and use loops to compute the factorial of a number, reverse a number, and find its multiples. Additionally, you will practice using loops to take user input and break the loop based on a condition. The classic FizzBuzz problem will reinforce logical conditions, and finally, you will generate a descending number pattern using loops. These exercises will strengthen your problem-solving skills and enhance your ability to work with user input, loops, and control structures in Python.
# PYTHON FUNCTIONS 
In this set of exercises, you will explore Python functions, their usage, and key concepts such as function parameters, return values, local and global variables, and default arguments. You will start by using the len() function to find the length of a list, followed by writing a function greet(name) that takes a person's name as input and prints a personalized greeting. Next, you will implement find_maximum(numbers), a function that finds the maximum value in a list without using Python’s built-in max() function by iterating through the list and comparing values.

You will then learn about local and global variables, understanding their scope within a function and how Python differentiates between them when they have the same name. Finally, you will create calculate_area(length, width=5), a function that calculates the area of a rectangle while demonstrating the use of default arguments. This function should assume a width of 5 if no width is provided by the user. These exercises will help you gain a deeper understanding of function behavior, variable scope, and parameter handling in Python.
# FILE AND EXECPTION HANDLING
In this set of exercises, you will work with file handling, exception handling, and basic input-output operations in Python. You will begin by reading a file and displaying its contents, followed by copying the contents of one file to another. Then, you will analyze a file to count the total number of words it contains.

Next, you will explore exception handling by prompting the user for input and ensuring that a string is converted safely to an integer. You will also validate a list of integers and raise an exception if any negative numbers are present. Additionally, you will compute the average of a list of integers, using try-except blocks to handle potential errors and a finally clause to display a completion message. Finally, you will create a program that prompts the user for a filename and writes a string to it, ensuring proper exception handling and printing a welcome message if the operation is successful. These exercises will help you build a solid foundation in handling files, working with user input, and implementing error handling mechanisms in Python.
